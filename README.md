This assignment utilizes Euler's Method and Runge-Kutta Method to approximate the solution to the differential equation dy/dt = t-y^2 with the range 0 < t < 2, 10 iterations, and initial point f(0)=1. This program will output two numerical results for y(2), one from Euler's Method and one from Runge-Kutta Method.
